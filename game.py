# Description: A game in which the user is driving a car down a straight road, from a top down perspective, and has
# to move left and right to avoid obstacles and pick up coins, and is given a score based on how long
# they survive and how many coins they pick up.
# 3 basic features:
# User input: We will incorporate this by having the player press the left and right arrow keys in order to move the car
# in either direction on the road
# Game over: We will incorporate this by having the player have three lives, of which they will lose one every time they
# hit an obstacle or go off road.
# Graphics: We will include sprites for the car, the obstacles, and the coins, and include a road for the background.
# 4 additional features:
# Health bar: The bar will have three hearts on it, and each time the car hits an obstacle it will lose one.
# Timer: A timer will tick up depending on how long the player survives, and points will be added depending on how long
# the player survives
# Collectibles: There will be collectible coins that will also increase the player score and dissapear when the car hits
# them.
# Enemies: Obstacles, like trash bins, rocks, etc. will move down the screen, giving the illusion that the car is driving
# forward, and the car will have to dodge them.
